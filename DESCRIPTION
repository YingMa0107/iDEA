Description: iDEA is a new method for analyzing single-cell RNAseq data. It integrates differential expression (DE) analysis and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) into a joint statistical framework, providing substantial power gains for both analytic tasks. iDEA requires gene-level summary statistics in terms of fold change/effect size estimates and their standard errors as input, which can be obtained using any existing single-cell RNAseq DE methods.
